# base-rs

A sensible base CI image for Rust projects.

Based on [`base`](https://codeberg.org/Expo/containers/src/branch/master/containers/ci/base), but adds Rust and Cargo.

The following targets are installed:

- `x86_64-unknown-linux-musl` (default)
- `x86_64-unknown-linux-gnu`
- `x86_64-unknown-windows-gnu`
